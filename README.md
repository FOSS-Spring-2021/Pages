## Welcome to FOSS 2021 Team D Github Page!

### Our Capstone Project

In general, most of the disciplines our team members come from are new to the Open Science world, and it is a challenge to convince peers and researchers in our disciplines to adhere to these new principles. We are taking the first steps to bridge the gap between Open Science and FAIR principles and our current work research envirionments. We wanted our capstone to reflect some of the initial first steps we are all attempting to make in our own research. 

Ida Sami was the only one in our group working with data, so for our project we decided to move her data to the CyVerse Data Store. We are doing this so her research partners can easily access her data on the cloud. Before, they only used Excel and stored the data on their local machines. Now, with the Data Store, Ida and her research group can begin to incoperate Open Scince & FAIR Principles into her work.  

We also decided to all look through Ida's Data Management plan and provide feedback as a team. The data management plan is allowing Ida to share her research process with stakeholders involved in the research project.

**What I Plan to Implement from FOSS:** I am very new to open science, and this course has really opened my eyes to what I should be doing in my research and Master's of Public Policy program. As first steps to begin down the path to open science, I would like to implement three resources: GitHub, DSWizard, and CyVerse. For GitHub, I would like to make my own page to showcase my research, as well as host any code I use. For DSWizard, I am going to revamp my lab's current DMP using this tool and make it as FAIR as possible. Finally, for future projects I would like to use the CyVerse Data Store to hold all of my data to the cloud for myself and collaborators to use. These will be my first initial steps using open science skills and I hope to use more in the future.
